## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tom, a full stack developer who has recently returned to the industry after an almost 3-year sabbatical. With over four years of experience in software development, I specialize in creating robust, scalable web applications using modern technologies.

#### During my career, I have worked extensively with both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. I am proficient in developing and maintaining complex database systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and have a strong background in cloud development using AWS.

#### In my previous roles, I led the development of innovative solutions that focus on automation, process improvement, and user experience. My ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and integrate into existing projects has consistently resulted in high-quality, efficient, and effective software solutions.

#### Currently, I am focused on developing a comprehensive portfolio showcasing my skills and projects. I am diving into Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS, alongside using ShadCN UI components. My goal is to build fully functional web applications from the ground up, demonstrating my ability to integrate modern tools and frameworks into cohesive, high-performance solutions.

The latest projects in this repository are a work in progress.
